# Project Title

SDM Workflow for the OpenPrioBio project.

## Description

Runs multi-year MaxEnt models for 10 forest bird species, at different spatial resolutions (Anthus pratensis @100m; Ciconia nigra @500m: Dendrocoptes medius @200m; Dryobates minor @1000m; Dryocopus martius @1000m; Phylloscopus sibillatrix @100m; Picus canus @1000m; Poecile montanus @200m; Poecile palustris @200m; and Sitta europaea @100m), for the whole of Germany. It uses both static and (time-)dynamic variables, with (occurrence and environmental) data from 2016 to 2024. The workflow runs the following steps: 1a occurrence data preparation; 1b environmental data extraction; 2a spatial block definition; 2b collinearity analysis; 3a model fitting; 3b model validation; 3c model prediction; 4a variable importance calculation; 4b response curve plotting; 4c response value extraction (for categorical variable); 04d model statistics; 5a exporting shapefile with used occurrence data
